# transfer_learning_pneumonia
In this I've used VGG16 architecture and used transfer learning to help ahieve a better accuracy.\n
In this there 5216 training images and 16 validation images. In this I've achieved 88.6% accuracy without fine-tuning of the model after\n
fine-tuning ,i.e., unfreezing the frozen layers of VGG16 architecture and using very low learning rate to train the model again which helped me achieve 90.3%.
